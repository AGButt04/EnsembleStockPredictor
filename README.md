# 📈 Stock Price Predictor (Work in Progress)

This project is my learning journey into **Machine Learning for finance**.  
I’m starting with Apple (AAPL) stock data using [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance), exploring the data with `pandas` and `matplotlib`, and will gradually build up to a machine learning model that predicts stock movements.

## 🚀 Goals
- Download and clean stock data
- Explore price trends with visualization
- Engineer features like moving averages and returns
- Train ML models (regression & classification)
- Compare predicted vs. actual prices
- (Later) Build a simple web app for predictions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- yfinance

## 📂 Project Status
Currently working on:
- Loading & cleaning AAPL stock data
- Plotting closing prices

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Add moving averages & daily returns
- Train a simple regression model
